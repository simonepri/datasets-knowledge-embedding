## Add a new dataset

If you want to add a new dataset to this collection, first you need to create three files called `train.tsv`, `valid.tsv`, and `test.tsv` containing respectively the edges for the three splits train, validation and test.  
The files must contain tab-separated triples of the form `(head entity, relation, tail entity)`.

Once you did this, you can simply process the three files with the following bash script.

```bash
bash build.sh train.tsv valid.tsv test.tsv .
```

The script uses the [edgelist-mapper][github:simonepri/edgelist-mapper] tool under the hood.
